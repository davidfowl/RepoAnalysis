**Objective**: Given a dataset of issues (like GitHub issues), I want to perform a detailed analysis, categorization, scoring, frustration analysis, and generate a roadmap. The categorization should be based on keyword matching, **semantic understanding** of the issue description, and **comment analysis**. The content of the issue bodies and comments should **not** be included in the output, aside from the metadata used for categorization.

### **Final Engagement Score Formula**

Use the following formula to calculate the **Engagement Score** for each issue:

\[
S = \frac{w_c \cdot C^{1.5} \cdot C_{penalty} \cdot w_d \cdot (D + 0.1) \cdot (1 + w_l \cdot A) \cdot (1 + w_u \cdot U)}{1 + w_a \cdot \sqrt{A + \epsilon}}
\]

Where:
- **\(C\)**: Total number of comments.
- **\(C_{penalty}\)**: 
  - \(C_{penalty} = 0.25\) if \(C < 10\),
  - \(C_{penalty} = 1.0\) otherwise.
- **\(D\)**: Distribution factor, representing how evenly comments are spread over the issue's lifespan.
- **\(A\)**: Age of the issue in years (\(A = \text{(LastUpdated - CreatedAt)}\)).
- **\(\epsilon = 0.1\)**: Small constant added to prevent division by zero or undervaluing very recent issues.
- **\(U\)**: Total number of upvotes (if available, otherwise treated as 0).
- **Weights**:
  - **\(w_c = 2\)**: Emphasizes the number of comments.
  - **\(w_d = 1\)**: Balances the importance of distribution.
  - **\(w_l = 0.5\)**: Boosts older issues for longevity.
  - **\(w_u = 0.5\)**: Boosts issues with upvotes to reflect their priority/interest.
  - **\(w_a = 1\)**: Penalizes older issues for staleness.

### **Handling Missing Upvotes**:
- **If the Upvotes Field is Missing**: Treat **Upvotes** as 0, meaning the **Engagement Score** will be calculated without any boost from upvotes.
- **If Upvotes Exist**: The **Upvotes** field will **boost the engagement score** by contributing to the overall calculation of the score.

### **Frustration Score Formula**

To quantify the **frustration** users are experiencing with various issues, we can create a **Frustration Score** based on several factors such as:

\[
F = \left( w_c \cdot C \right) + \left( w_s \cdot S \right) + \left( w_r \cdot R \right) + \left( w_t \cdot T \right)
\]

Where:
- **\(C\)** = Number of comments on the issue.
- **\(S\)** = Sentiment score, based on the proportion of negative sentiments (e.g., using keywords like "bug", "error", "frustrating").
- **\(R\)** = Recurrence factor, a score indicating how often users bring up the issue.
- **\(T\)** = Time factor, where older issues get higher scores.

---

### **Step-by-Step Process**:
1. **Number of Comments**: Directly taken from the dataset.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: We analyze the comments for negative keywords related to frustration.
3. **Recurrence**: Based on how many times the issue has been referenced in other issues or re-opened over time.
4. **Time Opened**: Calculate the age of the issue and increase the frustration score if the issue has been unresolved for a long time.

---

### **Initial Weights Proposal**:
- **\(w_c = 1\)**: The number of comments is a significant indicator of frustration.
- **\(w_s = 2\)**: Negative sentiment typically correlates strongly with frustration.
- **\(w_r = 1.5\)**: Recurrence is important but less impactful than sentiment or comments.
- **\(w_t = 0.5\)**: Older issues cause more frustration, but not as much as direct sentiment or comment count.

### **Table Output (CSV)**:

The output dataset will now include **Upvotes** as part of the analysis, along with **Engagement Score** and **Frustration Score**. The columns in the CSV should be as follows:

| **Title**                                                   | **URL**                                                     | **Comment Count** | **Unique Commenters** | **Upvotes** | **Engagement Score** | **Years Opened** | **Frustration Score** |

### **Outcome**:
1. **Upvotes** are included in the calculation of the **Engagement Score** if available, and treated as 0 if missing. This ensures the formula works for both new and older datasets.
2. The **Frustration Score** and other metrics remain unchanged, providing a **comprehensive view** of issue engagement and user frustration.
3. The updated table will reflect **Engagement Score** and **Frustration Score** based on these new variables, ensuring accurate insights across datasets.
